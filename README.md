# Hi Im Ebony!

Im a 29 year old memphis resident. I've been a natural hairstylist for over 10 years but now am shift my focus into software development

I learned how to do hair by watching youtube videos back in 2008 when youtube first popped off, and you didnt have to pay for professionals to teach you basic hair skills.
